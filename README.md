# CISC101-Group102-PaperSummarizer

## This repo contains instructions for an LLM to act as an academic paper summarizer. There are two main parts: System prompt and modules. 

### System Prompt:
##### The system prompt includes a general overview of the task for the LLM, broad instructions, and descriptions of how the modules work together. 

### Modules:
#####  The modules folder contains all the modules that the LLM will run. These include intake and setup, section loop, guardrails, rendering and refinement, citation extractor, and citation generator.

### The correct way to run the contents of this repo is to enter the system prompt into the prompt slot of the LLM and attach the modules as files.
